        <p>

            Bat is a nicely carved equipment made out of special wood, with a handle on top to hold and play. These vary
            in weight and size with age and requirement of the batsman.One of the most important cricket equipments used
            by a batsman, a cricket bat is a wooden piece of equipment which is used to face the ball. It is either made
            of a Kashmiri willow or English willow tree. The measurement of a cricket bat should be 38 inches (96.5 cm)
            long and 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide. Also, the use of aluminium bats is not allowed in cricket. It is
            attached with a long handle used to grip the bat properly. Its front portion is flat while its back portion
            has a slender curve, giving the bat thickness and balance.

        <h>2 Ball :</h>


        <P>
            One of the two important cricket equipments in the game, a cricket ball is used by the bowlers to get the
            batsmen out. In cricket, the ball is used in three colours. In Test Cricket, the red ball is used, while the
            white ball is used in 50 over and 20-over game. Also, in recent times, pink-ball cricket is taking shape as
            Pink Ball has also been used while playing Test cricket. A cricket ball should have a circumference of 9.1
            in (23 centimetres). The standard circumference of a ball used in cricket is 9 inches. Made of cork, the
            cricket ball is covered with leather and wrapped in twine, which is stitched to form a seam.
        </P>

        <h>3 Gloves :</h>

        <P>


            In cricket, equipment like Gloves is worn by a batsman as well as a wicket-keeper. Though, both are very
            different in shape. Batsmen use gloves while batting. Wearing gloves help them grip the bat nicely and also
            protect the hands from hitting the ball. Wicket-keepers, on the other hand, wear gloves while
            wicket-keeping. They use to mainly to catch the ball as it protects them from any injury.

        <h> 4 Wickets :</h>


        <P>
            In cricket, a wicket is also a cricket-equipment, which is a set of three stumps placed along with two bails
            at the top. The term wicket also has other meanings in the game. When a bowler dismisses a batsman, then
            also it is termed as a wicket, while the pitch is also called a wicket as said in the laws of cricket.

            Stumps are three vertical posts which are 9 inches wide and 28 inches tall and when supports with the bail
            form a wicket. There are three stumps placed in a wicket- off stump, centre stump and leg stump.
        </P>

        <h><b>5 Helmet :</b></h>


        <P>
            A piece of important cricket equipment for the batsman, Helmet is worn by a batsman to protect his head from
            hitting the ball. It is made of hard plastic and metals together For the same purpose, a wicket-keeper also
            uses a helmet while standing at the stumps.
            Modern day cricket helmets are made in compliance with the recent safety standards of the International
            Cricket Council (ICC) and have to conform to the British Standard BS7928:2013. Materials used for making
            cricket helmets are impact resistance materials like ABS Plastic, Fibreglass, carbon fibre.
        </P>

        <h>6 Bails :</h>


        <P>
            Bails are the smallest equipment placed on stumps. It helps in giving easy decisions by umpires to dismiss
            the batsman when the wicket is broken. A bail is one of the two smaller sticks placed on top of the three
            stumps to form a wicket. The bails are used to determine when the wicket is broken or put down, which in
            turn is one of the critical factors in determining whether a batsman is out bowled, stumped, run out or hit
            wicket.

        <p>

        <ol class="rules">
            <li>
                A match in cricket is played between 2 teams. Each team has 11 players. Before playing the match, the
                umpire tossed the captains of the two teams. The team that wins the toss decides whether to bat or
                field.
                One team bats and the other team fields the ball. Those who bat first try to score maximum runs against
                the
                opposition team.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Every cricket match has two innings. In the first innings, one team bats and tries to score as many runs
                as possible, giving the opposing team a target of runs. In the second innings, the opposing team chased
                that
                run. If the opposing team can score that run, they can win, and if they can’t, they will be losers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                During the game, two batsmen of the batting team came to bat on the field. A striker batsman plays the
                ball, and another non-striker batsman runs with the striker batsman to score runs. When one batsman is
                out
                another batsman comes to bat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                All 11 members of the fielding team are in the field. One player bowls and the other 10 fields, the one
                who bowls is called a bowler. A fielder stands behind the striker to catch the batsman’s missed balls,
                called the wicketkeeper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Each bowler bowls one over. There are 6 balls in one over. After one bowler bowls one over, another
                bowler
                comes to the bowl the next over.

        <h> Ways to Score Runs </h>
        <p>
            There are many ways to score runs in cricket, now we explain the rules
        </p>

        <ul>

            <h>1: BY BATTING</h>

            <p>
                After the striker batsman hits the ball and returns the ball from the fielder to the
                wicketkeeper/bowler, the number of times the two batsmen alternate is the number of runs scored., it can
                be one, two, or more runs. There are also four runs and six runs. If the ball crosses the boundary after
                hitting the ground then it is FOUR runs, in cricket terms it is called a boundary and if the ball
                crosses the boundary and hits the ground after hitting the bat then it is six runs in cricket terms is
                called an over-boundary.
                According to the rules of cricket, there are other runs including no ball, wide ball, bye, and leg bye.
                <br>
            </p>


            <h> 2: WIDE BALL</h>

            <p>
                If a ball goes past the batsman, where the batsman cannot make a run, the umpire declares the ball as a
                wide ball and one run is added to the batsman team.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h> 3: No Ball</h>


            <p>
                There are some rules in cricket, if a bowler does not obey those rules, then the umpire declares
                the ball as a no-ball.<br>

                1. If the bowler foot crosses the bowling line then it is a no-ball.<br>

                2. If it bounces more than twice, i.e. the ball goes over the batsman head more than twice, then it
                is a no-ball.</li>

                3. If the fielders are standing in an illegal position then it is a no-ball. <br>
                A batsman has no other outs except a no-ball run out. And for a no-ball, the batsman gets a free
                hit on the next delivery, but the batsman has no other out than a runout.<br>

            </p><br>

            <h>4: BYE RUN </h>
            <p>
                When a batsman hits the ball somewhere else on his body while playing the ball, then the umpire declares
                the run as a bye run. Ans after the batsman hits the ball, the run taken by the batsman is declared as a
                bye run if no other fielder catches the ball while the fielder is fielding the ball back.
            </p>


            </p>

            <h>Many Ways Can a Batsman be Out </h>
            <p>
                A batsman can be out in different ways. When a batsman is out by a bowler, then is called the bowler has
                taken a wicket. According to the rules of cricket, the batsman’s out is as follows.
            </p>

            <h>1: Bowled out</h>

            <P>
                If the ball hits the striking batsmen’s wicket, it is called a bowled out.
            </P>



            <h> 2: Caught out</h>

            <p>
                After a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball with his bat or hands/gloves if a fielder catches the
                ball
                before it touches the circle ground, the batsman is out, called a caught out.
            </p>

                width="220">
            <br>


            <h>3: Leg Before Wicket (LBW)</h>
            <p> There are two rules in LBW are :-</p>

            <ul class="LBW">

                <p>

                    1: If the ball hits the leg of the batsman first without hitting the bat, then the umpire decides
                    LBW.
                    However, the umpire has to follow some rules in cricket to give this out. <br>
                    2: The umpire has to judge whether the ball would have hit the wicket without the batsman. If in his
                    judgment the ball hits the wicket, the umpire declares it as out.
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h>4: Stumped out</h>

            <p>
                If a batsman goes outside the popping pitch to hit the ball and misses the ball, then the wicketkeeper
                catches the ball and stumps out before the batsman comes back inside the popping pitch.
            </p>

            <h>5: Run Out</h>

            <p>
                A batsman runs from one end of the pitch to the other end to score runs after hitting the ball.<br> If a
                fielder
                hits the wicket by the ball before the batsman reaches the other end, the batsman is out. This is called
                run
                out.

            The Cricket Pitch is the rectangular area at the center of a Cricket infield that is divided from the
            infield by a series of dots or another white line. Two lines called creases are painted along the pitch, and
            help determine whether a pitch or hit is within the playing rules of the game.<br>
            Cricket Pitches have an overall length of (20.12 m) between wickets and a playing width of (3.05 m). The
            width of the bowling crease is (264 cm) with a minimum popping width of 12' (366 cm) in front. The Wicket is
            placed (122 cm) back from the popping crease.
