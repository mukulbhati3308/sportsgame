    <h>Physical Fitness</h>
    <p>
        Physical Fitness is very important in a personâ€™s life. Physically fit people are much more productive &
        successful in their life, not only that; they hold a lot of health benefits over the people who are not fit.
        Staying fit is not a big deal but being healthy is a bit challenging because health defines your overall body
        health. Either it is your social wellbeing, mental peace, or physical health. So, we should always be happy and
        eat good food to be healthy as well as fit.<br>

        <h3>The five components of complete fitness are:</h3>

        <li> Cardiovascular Endurance.</li>
        <li>Muscular Strength.</li>
        <li>Flexibility.</li>
        <li>Body Composition</li>
