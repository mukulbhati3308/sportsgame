        HYDRATION
    </H>
    
    <p>
    Drinking enough water each day is crucial for many reasons: to regulate body temperature, keep joints lubricated, prevent infections, deliver nutrients to cells,<br> and keep organs functioning properly. Being well-hydrated also improves sleep quality, cognition, and mood.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Hydration is replacing the lost fluid, particularly water, in something. The term hydration is often used in terms of adding water to the human body that has been lost, usually by drinking. <br>Someone might speak of being well-hydrated, meaning there is plenty of water in their body. A definition of hydration would not be<br> complete without mentioning its antonym, dehydration. Dehydration occurs when water is removed from something, or when there is an inadequate supply of water.

<h2>Best and Worst Sources of Hydration</h2>
<p>
    There are plenty of other ways to stay hydrated, however. Other drinks, including milk, soda, electrolyte drinks, coffee, tea, juice, lemonade, etc. can help fulfill some of the body's daily water needs. There is at least some amount of water in all of these drinks. Adding ice to a drink will also help a person meet their hydration needs.<br>

Many foods contain a large amount of water. Eating these foods will help a person stay hydrated. Fresh fruit, some vegetables, and soup all contain water. Melons, berries, citrus fruit, tomatoes, lettuce, and celery are among the foods that contain a lot of water. Watermelon, for example, is around 90% water.
